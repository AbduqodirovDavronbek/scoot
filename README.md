I created this web site for Coursework 1 from Web Technology module.
This website was created to fulfill Web Technology moduleâ€™s requirements and does not represent an actual company or service.
I created this website through https://www.figma.com/file/U0JuJeQR4P1cwN3taXf8dJ/imtihon-2-ws-8-(Copy)-(Copy)-(Copy)?t=kttjIB7Qsmvt45Sl-0 this design.
i haven't finished it yet. I created only main page. However, I created two different web sites.
I tried with all of my efforts. I used all of my front-end skills.
